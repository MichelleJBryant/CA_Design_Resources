## Q4. How confident are you in understanding code problems and coming up with a coded solution?

* "I often don't know where to start and I need a lot of support and structure in coming up with a solution to problems”
* "I can write pseudocode for most problems but struggle to transfer that to usable code”
* "I can solve code problems but it requires some time and many attempts at writing usable code”

## Q5. What answer best describes your view of coding best practices? (Such as refracting code for it be DRY)

* "I just code to for a solution that will work at this stage”
* "It is important to me that certain parts of the code is DRY and readable, but am not phased if not all of the code is like this. Some refactoring will be used”
